initialxy-irswitch
==================

This is my personal Raspberry Pi project to reset my ISP provided modem/router when it stops working. It does so by emitting 433 MHz IR signals to an IR controlled power outlet used by my modem/router. This project provides two modes: automatic and manual by using a web app. Given that my modem/router usually works for intranet even when it becomes unable to reach out to WAN, the Raspberry Pi hosted web app will service its purpose most of the time.
